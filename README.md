# PIL Power Rankings

Deriving Season 2 PIL team power rankings from records on the last year of ice TOTD maps.

## Methodology

1. Gather a list of 2024 icy TOTDs.
2. Resolve player UIDs from usernames (can reuse some from PIL S1).
3. Rank each player within each map.
4. Drop each player's highest and lowest rank - Olympic scoring.
5. Use players' average ranks to calcuate a "campaign score" leaderboard.
